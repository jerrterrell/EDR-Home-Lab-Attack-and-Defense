# EDR-Home-Lab-Attack-and-Defense

This lab is dedicated to simulating a real cyber attack and endpoint detection and response. Utilizing Eric Capuano's guide online, I will be using virtual machines to simulate the threat & victim machines. The attack machine will utilize 'Sliver' as a C2 framework to attack a Windows endpoint machine, which will be running 'LimaCharlie' as an EDR solution.
